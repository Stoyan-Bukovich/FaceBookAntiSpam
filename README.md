# Facebook Anti-Spam

Let's give back Facebook's Messenger spammers a little bit of their own medicine.

This code creates and sends a lots of web requests to particular url, using up spammer's server resources if left running for long time.

The code pretends to be a valid web browser of different devices with each web request.

This is an console application. To use it you would need to compile it first.

It does required dotnet core installed on your machine prior compiling it.

If you would like to use it for different urls, please modify the code as fits your case.
